        Comprehensive Everest Base Camp Trek Guide
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-xl">
        Your trek to Everest Base Camp starts with an awe-inspiring 45-minute
        flight from Kathmandu to Lukla. Lukla (2,840m/9,317 ft) is the starting
        and endpoint of the trek. After getting off the flight at the Lukla
        Airport, the long hike in the Khumbu Region begins, and your destination
        for this day is Phakding. The next day will take you into the Sagarmatha
        National Park to Namche Bazaar, the gateway to Mount Everest. You will
        acclimatize for a day in Namche. After acclimation for a day, you will
        leave Namche Bazaar and continue your journey by heading to Tengboche -
        another Khumbu region gem. The way from Namche to Tengboche goes up and
        down, and from the path, you will get to savor the views of Nuptse,
        Lhotse, and more. You will spend the night at Tengboche. The following
        morning, you will collect yourself and continue your journey by trekking
        to Dingboche (4410m/14470ft), from where we can see the entire Himalayan
        ranges in the Khumbu region. You will head to Dingboche from Tengboche.
        Pangboche Monastery, built in the 16th Century, lies on the way to
        Dibgboche. In the Dingboche region, you will see barley, buckwheat, and
        potato fields surrounded by stone walls to protect them from wind and
        wild animals. By reaching Dingboche, you will have gained a high
        altitude, and once more, it is time for acclimatization. After spending
        a day at Dingboche, you will trek to Lobuche (4,940m/16,210 ft) walking
        alongside the Khumbu Glacier, but you start on the trail that ascends to
        the Pheriche village. As you move forward, you will enjoy the views of
        Pumori, Lingtren, and Khumbutse, and arrive at Lobuche. You will spend
        that night at Lobuche. After a night at Lobuche, you are on the final
        big day of reaching the base camp. However, before reaching EBC, you
        will hike to Gorak Shep (5,164m/16,942 ft). At Gorak Shep, you will
        leave your belongings and walk alongside the Khumbu Glacier until you
        reach the EBC. You will stay at EBC for some time and take a short break
        basking in the natural beauty around the world's highest peak. Reaching
        Everest Base Camp is a huge achievement for mountaineers and
        adventurers. You will return to Gorak Shep for the evening and spend the
        night there. Now the return begins, you will mostly follow the path that
        took you to EBC to return to Namche and then to Lukla. You will spend
        the night at Lukla, anticipating a return to Kathmandu the next day. If
        everything is planned out, you will return to Kathmandu via flight from
        Lukla on your fourteenth day.

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">History</h4>
      <p className="mb-4 text-xl">
        Mount Everest was first recognized as the world tallest mountain in
        1856. The British Expedition of 1953, led by Sir Edmund Hillary and
        Tenzing Norgay Sherpa, became the first to reach the Everest summit.
        Since then, EBC has served as a starting point for climbers attempting
        to conquer the highest peak on Earth.

        encompasses steep ascents and descents, rocky paths, suspension bridges,
        and challenging weather conditions.

        Pack Wisely: Prioritize warm clothing, quality trekking boots, and
        essential gear. Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water to combat
        altitude-related dehydration. Local Cuisine: Embrace local foods for
        energy and acclimatization benefits.
