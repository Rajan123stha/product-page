          In peak trek seasons (March, April, May, Sept, October, and November),
          Lukla flights from Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) may be
          rerouted to Manthali Airport due to traffic congestion. So, during
          these months, our guide will pick you up from your hotel at around
          12:30 am for a five-hour drive to Manthali. From Manthali, you will
          take a 20-minute flight to Lukla. In other months (December, January,
          February, June, July, and August), you will take a 40-minute flight to
          Lukla from Kathmandu.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          If you want to avoid the drive to Manthali from Kathmandu, you can
          book a helicopter to Lukla. However, it will cost you around 550 USD
          extra, provided five persons share the cost.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Our journey to EBC, which begins from Lukla, will be very exciting, as
          it will be our 1st day of the trek. We will leave Lukla and trek
          through Chaurikharka village and descend to Dudhkoshi Ghat (2,530m /
          8,300ft) until we reach Phakding. Today's trek will be short and
          enjoyable as we will also be acclimatizing. We can spend our spare
          time visiting local monasteries (like Rimishung Monastery) and
          preparing ourselves for a long trek the next day.

          We will wake up in the morning and continue trekking along the
          northern bank of the Dudh Koshi River while enjoying the majestic
          views and crossing many suspension bridges over the Dudh Koshi River,
          including the Hillary Suspension Bridge. As we move forward, we arrive
          at the Sagarmatha National Park check post, where we will have our
          permits registered and then climb up through the dense forests. From
          this forest, we will catch the first sight of Mt. Everest. Trekking
          further, we will arrive at Namche Bazaar- the gateway to Everest.

          It is time to acclimatize at Namche Bazaar itself. We recommend you to
          explore Namche Bazaar, as this town hosts numerous wifi-linked cafes
          and restaurants, souvenirs, and gear shops. We have several hiking
          options - such as visiting Hillary School, Sherpa settlement,
          Syangboche Airport, and yak farms. If you are passionate about
          Everest, you should not miss hiking up to Everest View Hotel, from
          where you can catch the breathtaking views of Mt. Everest.
